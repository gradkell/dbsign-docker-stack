DBsign installation and configuration files go here.

Required files:

* ./config/DBsign.cfg
* ./config/DBsignLogger.cfg
* ./config/license.lic
* ./config/notary.bcfks
* ./files/HTML/Server/dbsign.war

Typically you would place the contents of the "files" directory from the DBsign installation media in "./files".
